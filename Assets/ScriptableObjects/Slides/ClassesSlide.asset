  slideContents: "C# is an Object-Orientated programming language. This means that
    the design of the program is organised around data or objects, instead of functions
    and logic. Though this sounds complicated, it simply means that all code must
    be within a class. \n\nClasses, like namespaces, need a name as an identifier:\n\n<color=#0000a0ff>class</color>
    <color=yellow>MyClass</color> \n{\n}\r\n\nLike with namespaces, the braces contains 
    the scope of the class' member variables and methods/functions."
