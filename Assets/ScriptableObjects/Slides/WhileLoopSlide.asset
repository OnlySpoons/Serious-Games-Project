  slideContents: "While Loops are similar to For Loops, but are written differently
    and are for a different purpose. In this case we only need to specify a condition
    for the loop, and it will run until the condition is false, and will keep running
    if the condition is true. This can be written as shown below:\n\n<color=#0000a0ff>while</color>
    (condition)\n{\n  <color=#00d3d3d3>code block to be exectued;</color>\n}\n\nThere
    is also the do/while version of this loop. This version will run the code block
    first and then check the condition afterwards. An example is shown below:\n\n<color=#0000a0ff>do</color>\n{\n  
    <color=#00d3d3d3>code block to be exectued;</color>\n}\n<color=#0000a0ff>while</color>
    (condition)\n\nBelow is a proper example of a while loop is shown below:\n\n<color=#0000a0ff>while</color>
    (<color=#00ffffff>y</color> < <color=#808000ff>3</color>)\n{\n   <color=green>Console</color>.<color=yellow>WriteLine</color>(<color=#00ffffff>y</color>)\n  
    <color=#00ffffff>y++</color>;\n}"
