  slideTitle: If Statment
  slideContents: "One of the most useful things we have access to in C# is If Statments.
    These allow us to add conditionals to our programs so they will perform certain
    actions if they meet certain conditions. So if some value is equal to another,
    then that certain section of code will be run. This can be written as shown below:\n\n<color=#ff00ffff>If</color>
    (<color=#0000a0ff>x</color> == <color=#0000a0ff>y</color>) \n{\n       <color=green>Console</color>.<color=yellow>WriteLine</color>(<color=orange>\"Hello
    World!\"</color>);\n}\n\nInside the If Statment, you will notice a double equals.
    This is a Comparison Operator. In other words, it means \"equal to\" where a
    single equals means \"equals\". There are other comparitive operators, which
    we will cover in a future slide. If Statments use comparitive operators because
    they are comparing data, rather than setting it - for the condition at least,
    normal operators are used in the actual code."
