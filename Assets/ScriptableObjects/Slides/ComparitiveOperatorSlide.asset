  slideTitle: Comparitive Operators
  slideContents: 'We''ve already seen the "equal to" Operator in the If Statment
    slide. We will now go over more of those here. We can use Comparitive operators
    to compare variable or other pieces of data against each other. The rest of which
    are shown below:


    != or Not Equal To - This operator is used to see if pieces
    of data do not match each other. e.g. x != y


    > or Greater Than - This operator
    is used to see if one piece of data is bigger than another. e.g. x > y


    <
    or Less Than - This operator is the opposite of the previous, seeing if one piece
    of data is less than another. e.g. x < y


    An equals sign can also be placed
    in front of either of the last two operators to also check if the value is equal
    to it. e.g. x >= y is "Is x greater than or equal to y?"'
