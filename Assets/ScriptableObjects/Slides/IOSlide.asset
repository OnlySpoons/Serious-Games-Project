  slideTitle: Interacting with the console
  slideContents: "Before you write your first program, you'll need to know how to
    interact with the console. \n\nIn/Out interactions are provided by accessing
    C#'s standard library of useful functions. To access the console, we must have
    access to the System library. This can be done by making use of the using keyword.
    \n\nOnce that's done, we can declare the following code inside our Main function:\n\n<color=green>Console</color>.<color=yellow>WriteLine</color>(<color=orange>\"Hello
    World!\"</color>);\n\nThe full stop after the Console allows us to access the
    WriteLine function, to which we provide a string with the text we want to print
    out. \n\nNow you're ready to combine all of these techniques and create your
    first program..."
