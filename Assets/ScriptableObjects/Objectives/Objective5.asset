  objective: Read an integer from input. Calculate and output the factorial of that
    input. The factorial of a number is equal to the multiplication of all the integers
    from 1 to that number, including 1 and itself.
  input: 5
  expectedOutput: 120
  hints:
  - The input can be used in the condition of the for loop (e.g., i <= input).
  - Remember, multiplying by 0 gives 0. So variables will have to start at 1.
  - Using a temporary variable can help track the current progress of the calculation.
